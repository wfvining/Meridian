# Meridian

Meridian is an Erlang implementation of the MAP-Elites algorithm
and a library for building programs that use MAP-Elites.

## MAP-Elites

MAP-Elites is an algorithm for mapping the "performance" of a genome
that describes the solution to a problem according to the phenotypic
descriptors of the genome. This is a bad description - The draft paper
is here (http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04909).

## Rationale

1. I wanted to write something non-trivial in erlang
2. MAP-Elites is cool
3. MAP-Elites benefits from concurrency and parallelism

## How it works

### Version 1

MapElites is defined as an OTP Behavior. In order to use it a module declasres 
```erlang
-behavior(map_elites).
```
and implements all of the required callbacks (described below). To run the algorithm 
the function `map_elites:start/4` is called.

When the algorithm starts there is a master process which does no work
except to track the total number of iterations and terminate the workers 
when enough have been performed. At that point the master loads the 
visualization. All workers share access to an ETS table where they write 
the results of their evaluations and drawn new genomes for mutation and evaluation.

When workers receive a stop message from the master, they terminate. 
Note that there is no guarantee that they will not do more iterations 
than are required, in fact it is likely that they will overrun by at least
one iteration. At worst the number of extra iterations that are performed 
_should_ be only the number of workers. 

The interface for starting a `map_elites` behavior is shown below.

```erlang
-spec start(Callbacks :: module(), 
            InitailPopulationSize :: integer(), 
            NumWorkers :: integer(), 
            Options :: list({atom(), term()})) -> ok.
```

Possible options are:

Option      | Description                               | default
------      | -----------                               | ----
name        | the name of the table that stores the map | `'unnamed_mape'`
granularity | the granularity of the map                | `256`
iterations  | the number of iterations (may be greatter)| `5000`

### Dependencies

You must have gnuplot installed and in your path for the visualization to work.
I think the output from the wx terminal looks better tha the qt terminal, so 
if you have that as the default terminal you will probably be happier.

### Usage
Users write a module that defines the following callbacks to implement
the `map_elites` behavior.

```erlang
-type genotype()  :: term().
-type phenotype() :: {genotype(), term()}.

%% return a random genome.
-callback init() -> genotype().
%% evaluate a genome and return the phenotype.
-callback evaluate(Genome :: genotype()) -> {ok, phenotype()}.
%% mutate a genome.
-callback mutate(Genome :: genotype()) -> genotype().
%% true if the phenotype A has "better fitness" than B.
-callback compare(A :: phenotype(), B :: phenotype()) -> boolean().
%% given a phenotype return the objective value.
-callback objective(phenotype()) -> float().
%% behavior descriptors must be non-negative.
-callback to_behavior(phenotype()) -> list(float()).
%% The returned tuples {A, B} must satisfy A < B furthermore the space
-callback behavior_space() -> list({float(), float()}).
```

#### Building
To build use rebar3 (http://github.com/rebar/rebar3).

```
$ rebar3 compile
```

This will compile all of the modules needed for writing a program
with Meridian and put them in a really annoying place (at some boint
the build system will be better, and the place will be less
annoyting).

In order to compile and run the examples (or your own modules) you
will need to add the directory that contains the `map_elites` behavior
to the code path (shown below).

```
$ erl
> code:add_path("/path/to/Meridian/_build/default/lib/Meridian/ebin").
> c('examples/knapsack'). % or whatever
```

#### TODO
[x] Need a faster way to lookup a random genome from the map. Currently this process is 
    O(n^d) where n is the granularity of the map and d is the dimensionality of the behavior space.
    It turns out that random lookups in an
    ETS table are not so straight forward and the simplest solution is to treat it like 
    a random lookup in a linked list.

**Concurrency**
    
[x] Workers update the map concurrently

[ ] Distribute workers across multiple nodes.

**Utilities**

[x] Binary genomes

[ ] Crossover and selection (? select N cells at random, chose the
"fittest one" and select the fittest neighbor -- out of eight
neighboring cells to use for xover).

**Visualization**

[x] Viz of the resulting matrix

[x] Faster viz

[ ] Visualize progress as the algorithm runs

**Results**

[ ] Reporting the elites at the end of the run.

[ ] Save lineages
